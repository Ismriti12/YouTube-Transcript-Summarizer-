# YouTube-Transcript-Summarizer-
A Chrome extension that will make a request to a backend REST API where it will perform NLP and respond with a summarized version of a YouTube transcript.

HuggingFace's transformers library is used in Python to perform **abstractive text summarization** on the transcript.

**Abstractive Summarization:** The model produces a completely different text that is shorter than the original, it generates new sentences in a new form, just like humans
do.
